# Website Request Prompt

I have a website idea I'd like to develop. Here's my initial concept:

So we're looking to build a strucutral / civil engineering consultancy website, to showcase what we do I want there to be 3d elements that showcase what we do, we have 3d revit models that can be exported to showcase what we do or Twinmototion models, help me come up with kind of our feature list here.

I'm looking to collaborate with you to turn this into a detailed project request. Let's iterate together until we have a complete request that I find to be complete.

After each of our exchanges, please return the current state of the request in this format:

2. Suggest features or considerations I might have missed
3. Help me organize requirements logically

We'll continue iterating and refining the request until I indicate it's complete and ready.
